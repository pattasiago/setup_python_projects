# Basic Setup For Python Projects:

Using:

- Poetry;
- Black Formatter;
- isort;
- Prospector;
- Pytest

To use it with pyenv config poetry to respect the current folder python version:

    poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true

Also, settings for VSCode were provided in settings.json to automatize the usage of black formatter, isort and prospector.
